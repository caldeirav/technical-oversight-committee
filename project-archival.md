# FINOS Project Archiving Process v1.0

Open source projects naturally go through different lifecycle stages. There are times when projects become inactive or no longer align with FINOS goals. In such cases, the TOC or project leads may recommend archiving.

## Triggering a Review to Archive

The FINOS TOC may initiate an archival review based on several factors, including:

- Requests to archive from the project team or wider FINOS community.
- Lack of activity on project mailing lists, repositories, or meetings.
- Security concerns, such as unresolved vulnerabilities.
- Misalignment with FINOS goals and lifecycle criteria.
- Project adoption and usage metrics.

Automated systems and community signals can prompt an archival review. It’s important to distinguish between projects that are feature-complete and those that are simply inactive. The archival process remains manual and requires a detailed review by the TOC.

## Archiving Process

The project archiving process is collaborative, allowing ample time for feedback and possible remediation. The TOC may halt the process at any time before a formal vote.

1. **Archival Review Initiated**: A review is triggered (see above).
2. **Health Inquiry**: A TOC or community member opens an issue to discuss the health of the project.
3. **Formal Archival Request**: A formal archival request is opened in the FINOS TOC GitHub repository and the project’s issue tracker, with cross-linking.
4. **Stakeholder Notification**: The TOC notifies the project maintainers and the wider FINOS community, usually delegated to FINOS staff.
5. **Project Review**: The TOC evaluates project health and considers feedback from the community and stakeholders.
6. **Final Comment Period**: The TOC issues a summary statement, followed by a two-week final public comment period.
7. **TOC Vote**: A formal vote is held after the comment period. A two-thirds majority is required to archive the project.

## Archived Status

When a project is archived, the following occurs:

- FINOS will no longer provide direct support or services for the project.
- The project will be listed on the FINOS archived projects page.
- FINOS retains trademarks and domain names associated with the project.
- The project will no longer receive marketing support.
- The project is free to continue development independently, with the potential for reactivation.

## Reactivating an Archived Project

Archived projects may be reactivated through the normal FINOS Project Lifecycle Process.
