## TOC Voting

The TOC would have 12 seats, each having a two year term
- 6 elected by the FINOS Governing Board
- 6 elected by the existing TOC members

Nominations are encouraged from both the community and the Governing Board. Nominees must either be active contributors or an employee of a member organisation. 

Candidates are expected to be:

- Engaged, and active - committing time to both formal meetings and various other activities. They should actively engage with FINOS Projects.
- Knowledgeable and professional
- Active advocates for FINOS
- Neutral - first-and-foremost representing the needs of the members
- Be present - at a minimum they are expected to prioritise and attend the TOC meetings.
- Serve a 2 year term on the TOC

The voting process has two rounds:

1. The FINOS Governing Board vote is conducted and 6 individuals elected
2. Following this, the TOC vote to fill the remaining seats

The Governing Board vote is conducted via the voting contacts, with one vote per member. 

In case an existing TOC member submits their candidacy for a second term, the member is allowed to vote in the election during TOC voting.

The TOC elects a Chair (serving a 2 year term), who will have a seat on the Governing Board. It is their responsibility to act as a liaison between the TOC and GB, and manage the TOC activities effectively. 

There is a minimum participation threshold for TOC members, with the expectation that they attend at least 50% of the scheduled TOC meetings, over a rolling quarter. If a member fails to meet this threshold, it triggers a discussion with the Chair, who will use their discretion to determine whether that member should release their seat, by making a recommendation to the GB.

TOC elections happen at most twice per calendar year. At the beginning Q1 and Q3 if there are any vacant TOC seats, a vote is held. Note, the composition of 6 seats filled via Governing Board vote and 6 via leadership vote is maintained through his voting process, with the exact seat numbers being determined based on vacancies.

The initial term for existing "pilot TSC" members and Chair who will retain their seat on the TOC will be 1 year.
