# TOC Responsibilities

This page describes the TOC responsibilities, and the processes that support each. At a very high-level, the TOC supports both the [FINOS team](https://www.finos.org/team) and the [Governing Board](https://www.finos.org/governing-board) to provide technical oversight for the projects in the FINOS portfolio.

The key responsibilities of the TOC for 2024 are tabulated below; prior responsibilities are documented on https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee/blob/april-9th/responsibilities.md

## Reactive, Supported by TOC
- A TOC Member supports designing and collecting use cases for hackathons and tech sprints - This is what I'm going to lead this year, I've few ideas in mind, which I'd be happy to share with the rest of the team. I'll get back to you on this when things are more in shape
- TOC Member support the creation (and recruitment) of a mentorship program - I'm working right now with Discover to run a summer mentorship on the Accessibility Theme Builder project, and they're mostly self sufficient ; I do not expect a lot to be done by the TOC here, but let's see how this mentorship goes.

## Proactive, Assigned to TOC
- Lead recruitment of 7+ Ambassadors - the TOC member is expected to engage with Grizz, understand how the Ambassador program works, find potential candidates and facilitate the connection with the FINOS team
- Recruit 5 project demos for OSFFs - Hopefully everyone in the TOC is familiar with OSFF and the project demos; Eteri is the point of contact from the FINOS team
- Each TOC member participates in OSFF promotional activities
(at least one podcast, video, blog) - this is quite self-explanatory
- TOC sponsor is actively engaged in the success of the strategic initiative - All FINOS Strategic initiatives have a TOC sponsor assigned; this person is expected to join meetings, provide technical steering and report back to the TOC ; these reports will be delivered to the FINOS Board on a quarterly cadence
- TOC engages with all projects incubating for over 1 year to nurture activation or archiviation - I think that this is worth decomposing a bit more, but starting simple, the idea is that a TOC member goes through FINOS Incubating projects and tracks activity on code (commits, PRs, issues, etc), consumption and marketing activity (newsletter, this week at FINOS, socials, etc)
- TOC produces a quarterly report on overall FINOS project landscape / health - Very similar to the previous item, but covering Active Projects and SIGs.
