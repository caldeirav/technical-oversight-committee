## Minutes

### Board meeting preparations
 - In future the board deck will be shared with TOC members earlier in the cycle
 - It is an opportunity for TOC members to share thoughts with the board

### TraderX contribution
 - Described as the 'pet store app for traders', a place to experiment with technology in a safe fashion
 - It was noted that this would be a useful project to integrate with some of the projects within FINOS
 - perhaps worth having a hackathon?
 - @brunodom to share positive conclusion to this contribution

### TOC vote
 - We briefly discussed the TOC vote
 - The candidates will be discussed in the next TOC meeting
