## Minutes

### Updates

 - Rob gave an update on the [Project Archiving](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/203) project
   - Rob & Elspeth have identified a short-list of projects that are candidates for archiving
   - All agreed that this is something that should be done in collaboration with maintainers
   - Next steps, Rob will arrange a one-off TSC member meeting to discuss the short-list and how to engage with maintainers.
 - Olivier gave a brief update on the [Compliance Horizon Scanning](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/195) contribution
   - The general feeling is that while this is a good idea, the contribution doesn't have quite enough substance (i.e. code) just yet
   - This has been discussed informally with the contributors who are happy to re-open when they have more to share

### FINOS Strategy

 - Gab shared the draft 2023 strategy which will be discussed and likely agreed at the board next week.

### TSC Responsibilities

 - When (if?) the TSC becomes formalised we need a better definition of the groups responsibilities. In order to gauge interest, each TSC member voted on four candidate responsibilities.
 - The results of the voting (one star = one vote) are reproduced here:

**A: Landscape ownership**
 - ⭐⭐⭐ Quarterly review of project health
 - ⭐⭐⭐ Quarterly review of project alignment with FINOS strategy
 - Recommend and approve life-cycle transitions
 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Solicit / recommend cross-project synergies
 - Yearly review of lifecycle criteria
 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Establish technical norms and best practice (inc. security)
 - ⭐ Categorise and evolve the landscape (landscape.finos.org)
 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Handle technical disputes

**B: Landscape growth**
 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Review and approve contributions
 - Nurture / solicit new project contributions
 - ⭐ Amplify / promote new contributions

**C: FINOS Strategy**
 - ⭐⭐ Work with the Board to identity use-cases / areas of interest 
 - ⭐⭐ Bottom-up influence of strategy base on landscape
 - Quarterly report to the board
 - Owning project discretionary budget
