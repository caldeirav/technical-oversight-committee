## Minutes

- @TheJuanAndOnly99 to create Github issue where TOC members can +1 if attending OSFF ; would help to also include when it's the arrival (there will be other events the days before OSFF) and T-shirt size
- @opoupeney proposes to have a TOC meeting at OSFF that is open for everyone to attend, enabling attendees to come and meet the FINOS TOC
- @opoupeney asks if the TOC can be of any help at OSFF to promote FINOS activities; having a "TOC Member" T-shirt may help being identifiable in the crowd
- @opoupeney volunteers to discuss parity within the TOC composition during next meeting (to be added in the next meeting agenda, or create issue and pull it into the backlog)
- Looking for some volunteer to validate Jupiterlab templates against the contribution criteria; see https://github.com/finos/community/issues/215
- The team agrees to add a TOC backlog board walkthrough during the bi-weekly call; see https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/39/views/1 (@maoo updates issue template)
- To improve efficiency and asynchronous work, TOC members are invited to "Watch" this Github repository, in order to get notified about new meeting agendas, candidacies and other issues created. Nevertheless, emails to toc@lists.finos.org are still the preferred mechanism for important notifications
